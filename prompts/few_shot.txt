Question: What are the symptoms of strep throat?
Answer: Strep throat typically presents with sudden sore throat, pain when swallowing, fever over 101Â°F, red and swollen tonsils (sometimes with white patches), tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Unlike viral infections, strep throat usually doesn't cause cough, runny nose, or hoarseness.

Question: How does insulin work in the body?
Answer: Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells in the pancreas that regulates blood glucose levels. When you consume carbohydrates, they break down into glucose in the bloodstream. The pancreas then releases insulin, which acts like a key that allows glucose to enter cells for energy use. In people with diabetes, either insufficient insulin is produced (Type 1) or cells become resistant to insulin's effects (Type 2), resulting in elevated blood glucose levels.

Question: What is the difference between Alzheimer's and dementia?
Answer: Dementia is a general term for symptoms affecting memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning. Alzheimer's disease is the most common specific cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases. While Alzheimer's is characterized by specific brain changes (amyloid plaques and tau tangles), dementia can be caused by various conditions including vascular issues, Lewy body disease, and others. All Alzheimer's patients have dementia, but not all dementia patients have Alzheimer's.
