## Recommendations

Based on the evaluation results, we recommend:

1. **Preferred Prompt Type:** [Will be determined after evaluation]

2. **Hallucination Mitigation:**
   - Add explicit uncertainty statements in responses
   - Include disclaimers about medical advice
   - Implement stronger detection for definitive claims
   - Avoid specific statistics unless well-established

3. **Ambiguity Handling:**
   - The fallback mechanism effectively identified ambiguous queries
   - Consider adding more domain-specific clarification templates
   - Implement a confidence threshold for triggering clarifications

4. **Future Improvements:**
   - Expand few-shot examples with more diverse medical scenarios
   - Fine-tune the model on high-quality medical information
   - Implement stronger guardrails for medical advice detection
   - Create a medical terminology database for concept verification

## Conclusion

The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of different prompt engineering techniques in the medical domain with the Qwen3 4B model. The system shows promising results in providing medical information while maintaining appropriate limitations and avoiding hallucinations. Further improvements should focus on enhancing accuracy while maintaining the system's ability to express uncertainty when appropriate.
