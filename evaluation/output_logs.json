          "prompt": "As a medical information assistant, here are some examples of how to answer healthcare questions:\n\nQuestion: What are the symptoms of strep throat?\nAnswer: Strep throat typically presents with sudden sore throat, pain when swallowing, fever over 101Â°F, red and swollen tonsils (sometimes with white patches), tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Unlike viral infections, strep throat usually doesn't cause cough, runny nose, or hoarseness. A medical professional should confirm diagnosis through testing.\n\nQuestion: How does insulin work in the body?\nAnswer: Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells in the pancreas that regulates blood glucose levels. When you consume carbohydrates, they break down into glucose in the bloodstream. The pancreas then releases insulin, which acts like a key that allows glucose to enter cells for energy use. In people with diabetes, either insufficient insulin is produced (Type 1) or cells become resistant to insulin's effects (Type 2), resulting in elevated blood glucose levels.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between Alzheimer's and dementia?\nAnswer: Dementia is a general term for symptoms affecting memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning. Alzheimer's disease is the most common specific cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases. While Alzheimer's is characterized by specific brain changes (amyloid plaques and tau tangles), dementia can be caused by various conditions including vascular issues, Lewy body disease, and others. All Alzheimer's patients have dementia, but not all dementia patients have Alzheimer's.\n\nNow please answer this medical question:\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetes?",
          "response": "The classic symptoms of diabetes include:\n\n1. Polyuria (frequent urination): When excess glucose builds up in your bloodstream, your kidneys work harder to filter and absorb it. When they can't keep up, the excess glucose is excreted into your urine, drawing along fluids from your tissues, making you urinate more frequently.\n\n2. Polydipsia (increased thirst): The frequent urination can lead to dehydration, causing you to feel thirstier than usual.\n\n3. Polyphagia (increased hunger): Without enough insulin to move glucose into your cells, your muscles and organs become energy-depleted, triggering intense hunger.\n\n4. Unexplained weight loss: Despite eating more, you may lose weight. Without glucose moving into your cells, your body begins breaking down fat and muscle for energy.\n\n5. Fatigue: When your cells are deprived of glucose, you may feel tired and irritable.\n\n6. Blurred vision: High blood sugar levels can cause fluid to be pulled from your tissues, including the lenses of your eyes, affecting your ability to focus.\n\nOther symptoms may include slow-healing sores, frequent infections, numbness or tingling in the extremities (for type 2 diabetes), and in type 1 diabetes, nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains may occur.\n\nSymptoms typically develop quickly in type 1 diabetes, while they may develop gradually or be subtle in type 2 diabetes. Some people with type 2 diabetes may not experience symptoms for years. If you experience these symptoms, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.",

          "prompt": "As a medical information assistant, please answer the following healthcare question. Think through your reasoning step by step before providing your final answer.\n\nQuestion: What are the symptoms of diabetes?\n\nLet me reason through this systematically:\n1) First, I'll consider what medical concepts are involved in this question\n2) Then, I'll analyze relevant mechanisms, causes, or processes\n3) Next, I'll evaluate important distinctions or differential considerations\n4) Finally, I'll formulate a clear, accurate answer based on established medical knowledge\n\nReasoning:",
          "response": "Reasoning:\n\n1) Medical concepts involved:\n   - Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels\n   - There are primarily two types: Type 1 (autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells) and Type 2 (insulin resistance)\n   - Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy\n   - Symptoms reflect the body's inability to properly utilize glucose\n\n2) Relevant mechanisms:\n   - In diabetes, either insufficient insulin is produced or cells don't respond properly to insulin\n   - This leads to high blood glucose (hyperglycemia)\n   - The body tries to eliminate excess glucose through urine\n   - Cells are unable to get sufficient glucose for energy despite high blood glucose levels\n   - These mechanisms drive the characteristic symptoms\n\n3) Important distinctions:\n   - Type 1 diabetes symptoms typically develop rapidly and can be severe\n   - Type 2 diabetes symptoms often develop gradually and may be mild initially\n   - Some symptoms overlap between types, while others are more specific\n   - Some people, especially with type 2, may be asymptomatic initially\n\n4) Based on established knowledge, here are the symptoms of diabetes:\n\nThe classic symptoms of diabetes include:\n\n- Polyuria (frequent urination): Excess glucose in the bloodstream causes the kidneys to work harder to filter and absorb it. When they can't keep up, glucose is excreted in urine along with fluids from tissues.\n\n- Polydipsia (increased thirst): The increased urination leads to dehydration, causing excessive thirst.\n\n- Polyphagia (increased hunger): Despite having high blood glucose, cells can't access it without proper insulin function, leading to hunger.\n\n- Unexplained weight loss (especially in Type 1): Without glucose available for energy, the body metabolizes fat and muscle, causing weight loss despite normal or increased eating.\n\n- Fatigue: When cells can't get glucose for energy, fatigue results.\n\n- Blurred vision: High blood glucose can cause fluid shifts in eye tissues, affecting vision.\n\nAdditional symptoms may include:\n\n- Slow-healing sores or frequent infections\n- Numbness or tingling in hands/feet (diabetic neuropathy)\n- Darkened skin patches (acanthosis nigricans), especially in neck and armpit areas (more common in Type 2)\n- Fruity-smelling breath (in diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious complication)\n\nType 1 diabetes symptoms often appear suddenly, while Type 2 symptoms develop gradually. Some people with Type 2 diabetes may be asymptomatic for years before diagnosis.",
