# Domain Analysis: Medical Question Answering

## Description
The medical domain focuses on healthcare information, clinical knowledge, and patient care.
This includes diagnostics, treatments, medical terminology, and healthcare processes.
The system aims to provide accurate medical information while clearly stating limitations
and avoiding providing direct medical advice that should come from healthcare professionals.

## Representative Tasks

### 1. Symptom Explanation
Users seeking information about symptoms and their potential causes

**Examples:**
- What are the early symptoms of diabetes?
- What causes frequent headaches?
- Why might someone experience shortness of breath?
- What are the common symptoms of the flu versus a cold?
- What might cause persistent fatigue?

**Requirements:**
- Clear explanation of symptoms
- Potential causes with appropriate qualifiers
- Warning signs that require medical attention
- Avoidance of definitive diagnostic language
- Appropriate medical disclaimers

### 2. Medical Term Simplification
Users asking for explanations of complex medical terminology in layman's terms

**Examples:**
- Explain what hypertension means in simple terms
- What is the difference between an MRI and a CT scan?
- What does "arrhythmia" mean?
- Explain what a "lipid panel" measures
- What is the endocrine system?

**Requirements:**
- Clear, jargon-free explanations
- Analogies and examples where helpful
- Contextual information about relevance to health
- Appropriate level of detail for general audience
- Connection to related medical concepts

### 3. General Health Guidance
Users seeking evidence-based health information and wellness advice

**Examples:**
- When should someone see a cardiologist?
- How much exercise is recommended for heart health?
- What foods can help lower cholesterol?
- Should I be worried about chest pain?
- How can I improve my sleep quality?

**Requirements:**
- Evidence-based information
- Clear safety warnings for serious symptoms
- Emphasis on professional medical consultation
- Balanced presentation of options
- Appropriate medical disclaimers

## Challenges

### Safety Considerations
- Avoiding language that could be interpreted as medical diagnosis
- Ensuring proper disclaimers about consulting healthcare professionals
- Identifying and flagging potentially serious symptoms
- Maintaining appropriate boundaries of medical information vs. advice
- Handling emergency medical situations appropriately

### Accuracy Requirements
- Providing medically accurate information based on current knowledge
- Avoiding outdated or controversial medical claims
- Expressing appropriate uncertainty when evidence is limited
- Covering key medical concepts comprehensively
- Balancing technical accuracy with understandability

### Hallucination Risks
- Making definitive claims about treatment efficacy
- Providing specific statistics without proper sources
- Giving personalized medical recommendations
- Inventing medical terms or treatments
- Overgeneralizing from limited medical knowledge

### Ambiguity Management
- Clarifying vague symptom descriptions
- Handling questions with multiple possible interpretations
- Addressing incomplete medical information in queries
- Managing expectations about diagnostic capabilities
- Providing general information when specific details are lacking
