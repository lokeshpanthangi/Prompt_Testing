        "Answer: Strep throat typically presents with sudden sore throat, pain when swallowing, fever over 101Â°F, red and swollen tonsils (sometimes with white patches), tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Unlike viral infections, strep throat usually doesn't cause cough, runny nose, or hoarseness. \n",

        "Question: How does insulin work in the body?\n",
        "Answer: Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells in the pancreas that regulates blood glucose levels. When you consume carbohydrates, they break down into glucose in the bloodstream. The pancreas then releases insulin, which acts like a key that allows glucose to enter cells for energy use. In people with diabetes, either insufficient insulin is produced (Type 1) or cells become resistant to insulin's effects (Type 2), resulting in elevated blood glucose levels.\n",

        "Question: What is the difference between Alzheimer's and dementia?\n",
        "Answer: Dementia is a general term for symptoms affecting memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning. Alzheimer's disease is the most common specific cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases. While Alzheimer's is characterized by specific brain changes (amyloid plaques and tau tangles), dementia can be caused by various conditions including vascular issues, Lewy body disease, and others. All Alzheimer's patients have dementia, but not all dementia patients have Alzheimer's.\n",

Normal blood pressure is typically around 120/80 mmHg, with the first number representing systolic pressure (during heartbeats) and the second diastolic (between heartbeats). When this pressure consistently exceeds 130/80 mmHg, it's classified as hypertension. It can lead to serious health issues like heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage.

The key is to recognize warning signs such as persistent, crushing, or radiating pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or pain that worsens with exertion. If the person has risk factors for heart disease or has experienced similar symptoms before, this increases the likelihood of a cardiac cause. However, it's also important to consider non-cardiac causes, especially if the pain is described as sharp, localized, or related to eating.

            " Frequent headaches, or chronic headaches, can have multiple causes. The most common types of chronic headaches are tension-type headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches. Tension-type headaches are often caused by stress, poor posture, or muscle tension. Migraines are often triggered by certain foods, hormonal changes, or sensory stimuli. Cluster headaches are less common but more severe, often associated with circadian rhythms and specific triggers. Other potential causes may include sinus issues, dehydration, sleep disorders, or even certain medications. It's important to note that frequent headaches can also be a symptom of more serious conditions, such as brain tumors or aneurysms, although these are less common. A thorough medical evaluation is necessary to determine the exact cause.\n",

            "\n",
            "2) A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in heart and blood vessel conditions. They are involved in diagnosing and treating conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular issues. The key mechanisms involve the heart's structure and function, including the electrical system that regulates heartbeats, the circulatory system, and the various conditions that can affect these systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) It's important to distinguish between general symptoms that may be managed by a primary care physician and those that require the specialized knowledge of a cardiologist. For example, while a primary care physician might manage mild hypertension, a cardiologist would be needed for more severe cases or when complications arise. Additionally, the type of symptoms and the presence of risk factors can influence the decision to see a cardiologist.\n",
